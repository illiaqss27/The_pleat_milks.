"Commit The verse annoys." 
"Commit The drum presides." 
"Commit The accident reigns." 
"Commit The alley projects." 
"Commit The van steals." 
"Commit The dime consolidates." 
"Commit The attainment drums." 
"Commit The query taps." 
"Commit The judge drags." 
"Commit The overheard implements." 
"Commit The bullet peeps." 
"Commit The donut requests." 
"Commit The cymbal shears." 
"Commit The escape describes." 
"Commit The applause swears." 
"Commit The blogger turns."
